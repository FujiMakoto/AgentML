# SAML
Software Agent Markup Language

## Introduction
SAML is in simple terms an XML dialect for creating natural language software agents. It is a project inspired by AIML and RiveScript.

The documentation for this project is still under construction, but for a brief overview of what SAML is and how it works, you can refer to the current working draft:
